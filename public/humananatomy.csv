Human Body,Circulatory System,System comprised of the heart and blood vessels that transports oxygen nutrients and hormones throughout the body and eliminates carbon dioxide and metabolic waste
Human Body,Respiratory System,System consisting of airways and lungs that facilitates gas exchange by delivering oxygen to blood and removing carbon dioxide from the body
Human Body,Digestive System,System of organs that mechanically and chemically breaks down food into absorbable nutrients for energy and eliminates waste products
Circulatory System,Heart,Muscular organ composed of four chambers that pumps blood through the circulatory system to deliver oxygen and nutrients throughout the body
Circulatory System,Blood Vessels,Network of tubes including arteries veins and capillaries that carry blood throughout the body
Heart,Right Atrium,Upper right chamber of the heart that receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the vena cava
Heart,Left Ventricle,Lower left chamber of the heart that pumps oxygenated blood to the body through the aorta with high pressure
Heart,Heart Valves,Flap-like structures that open and close to ensure one-way blood flow through the heart chambers and prevent backflow
Heart Valves,Tricuspid Valve,Valve with three leaflets located between the right atrium and right ventricle that prevents backflow of blood into the right atrium
Heart Valves,Aortic Valve,Semilunar valve with three leaflets between the left ventricle and aorta that prevents backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle
Blood Vessels,Arteries,Blood vessels with thick muscular walls that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body tissues under high pressure
Blood Vessels,Veins,Blood vessels with thinner walls and valves that carry deoxygenated blood from body tissues back to the heart under low pressure
Arteries,Aorta,Largest artery in the body that carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to systemic circulation throughout the body
Arteries,Coronary Arteries,Arteries that branch from the aorta to supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle itself
Veins,Vena Cava,Largest veins in the body including superior and inferior vena cava that return deoxygenated blood from the body to the right atrium
Respiratory System,Lungs,Pair of spongy organs in the chest that facilitate gas exchange by absorbing oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide
Respiratory System,Airways,Passages including trachea bronchi and bronchioles that conduct air into and out of the lungs
Lungs,Right Lung,Larger lung with three lobes located on the right side of the chest cavity
Lungs,Left Lung,Smaller lung with two lobes located on the left side of the chest cavity to accommodate the heart
Right Lung,Upper Lobe,Superior section of the right lung that performs gas exchange
Right Lung,Lower Lobe,Inferior section of the right lung that performs gas exchange
Airways,Trachea,Windpipe with cartilage rings that conducts air from the larynx to the bronchi
Airways,Bronchi,Branching airways that extend from the trachea into each lung and further divide into smaller bronchioles
Bronchi,Primary Bronchi,First major branches of the trachea that enter each lung carrying air to the right and left lungs
Digestive System,Mouth,Oral cavity where food enters the body and mechanical digestion begins with chewing and saliva
Digestive System,Stomach,Muscular organ that stores food and begins protein digestion using hydrochloric acid and enzymes
Digestive System,Small Intestine,Long coiled tube where most chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs
Digestive System,Large Intestine,Final section of digestive tract that absorbs water and electrolytes and forms feces for elimination
Small Intestine,Duodenum,First and shortest section of small intestine where most chemical digestion occurs using enzymes and bile
Small Intestine,Ileum,Final and longest section of small intestine that absorbs remaining nutrients and vitamin B12
Large Intestine,Colon,Main part of large intestine that absorbs water and forms solid waste for elimination
Large Intestine,Rectum,Final straight section of large intestine that stores feces before elimination through the anus
Colon,Ascending Colon,Section of colon that travels upward on the right side of abdomen absorbing water
Colon,Sigmoid Colon,S-shaped section of colon that connects to rectum and continues water absorption
